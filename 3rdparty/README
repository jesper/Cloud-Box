kqoauth is not associated with the Cloud Box project, but meerly a dependency included for convenience.

I've included kqoauth to simplify packaging CloudBox + to have a predictable code base to work from.

Also, I suck at using qmake, so I've made some slight modifications (not suitable for upstream) and included them here as a patch.
